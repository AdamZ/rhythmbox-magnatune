/*
 * RBHistory is a GSequence that maintains a "current" pointer and can delete
 * an arbitrary element in amortized O(log(N)) time. It can call a deletion
 * callback when it removes one of its entries. RBHistory is a pure data
 * structure and can probably lose its GObject-ness.
 *
 * I may also add another "enqueued" pointer to help manage a queue of next
 * songs under shuffle.
 *
 * All operations take amortized O(log(N)) (worst-case O(N)) time unless noted
 * otherwise.
