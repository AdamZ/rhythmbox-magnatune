rhythmbox (0.4.99.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream prerelease (Closes: #204115)

    Sorry Debian Unstable users, you're my guinea pigs.  This is
    a prerelease.  It does however fix a near-infinite number of bugs,
    some of which you can see below.  So overall, I doubt anyone
    would want to stay with the old package.  If you don't like this,
    please don't file bugs.  Instead, you will have to fork a copy
    of net-rhythmbox yourself.

    Now, since this is a prerelease - I am interested in bug reports.
    You may file bugs in the Debian Bug Tracking System, but I would
    much prefer that you file them in the upstream Bugzilla:
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/

    However, it does break compatibility with the old library cache
    format; you will have to re-add all of your files to the library.  The
    upstream author is kind of a lazy bastard, and doesn't really have
    time to write transition scripts (which would be quite difficult
    anyways).  Sorry about that.
