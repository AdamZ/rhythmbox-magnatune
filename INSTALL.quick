Prerequisites
=============

Rhythmbox requires the following packages:

- A working GNOME 2.10 platform (more specifically, you need glib-2.6, gtk+-2.6,
  gnome-vfs-2.10, libgnome-2.10, gconf-2.10 and libglade-2.10)
- Totem-plparser 1.1.3, which can be gotten by installing totem 1.1.3 or higher
- A recent version of GStreamer 0.8 (newer versions of GStreamer and gst-plugins
  are best)

  % ./configure                                  # run the 'configure' script
  % make                                         # build Rhythmbox
