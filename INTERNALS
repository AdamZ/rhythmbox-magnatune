* Rhythmbox Internals

This document will attempt to gather up some of the bits and pieces
I've learned while hacking Rhythmbox.  Rhythmbox is fairly complex,
and while some people would claim it is unnecessarily so, I think
writing a good music player is just not as simple as you might
think at first.  So, let's begin.

** The Shell  (RBShell, RBShellPlayer, RBSourceHeader, RBStatusBar, RBShellPreferences)

The shell is the outer Rhythmbox framework.  It controls the playback,
menus, preferences, and most of the user interface in general.  The core
component of the shell is RBShell, in shell/rb-shell.c.  It acts as
kind of a catch-all for the various bits of glue needed to keep
Rhythmbox working together.  It handles most of the menu callbacks,
handles the playlist addition/deletion interface, maintains
the tray icon, and forms the main widget which holds all of the widgets below.
Unfortunately because of this rb-shell.c is getting a fairly big, and
we plan to break it up into smaller classes eventually.

There are other more specialized components of the shell, such as
RBShellPlayer. RBShellPlayer is a widget which handles the
play/previous/next buttons, and contains various other widgets for the
status display and volume.  RBShellPlayer is a pretty important class,
because it contains a lot of the playback logic.

RBSourceHeader is that thingy with the "Hide Browser" button and the search
entry.

RBStatusBar is the thing on the bottom with the Shuffle and Repeat buttons
and the status output.

RBShellPreferences manages the user preferences.  It is just a dialog box
which pops up when you hit Edit->Preferences.

** Sources

Rhythmbox has an idea of multiple music "sources", like the Library
and (Internet) Radio.  The RBSource classes are basically the
user interface part of the "source" concept.

All of these sources derive from RBSource (sources/rb-source.[ch]),
which is an abstract base class.  RBSource has a number of methods
which the specific sources like the Library implement.  For example,
one of the simpler ones is:

gboolean	rb_source_can_pause		(RBSource *player);

So here, a source returns TRUE if it can pause (i.e. pause button should
be displayed).  Another example is the rb_source_get_status method,
which is called to display a status string at the bottom of the window.

The RBShell maintains a list of available RBSources.

** Backends

All RBSource instances use some sort of"backend" too.  The RBLibrarySource
has the RBLibrary.  RBIRadioSource has the RBIRadioBackend.  The RBGroupSource
uses the RBLibrary.  As you might expect, while the RBSource components act as
a "frontend", the various backends maintain all the data and don't deal much
with user interfaces.

** A first look at the Library

The Library is the main part of Rhythmbox; it is the thing that lets
you play local files.  We'll go over some of the most important things,
and then come back to it later once we know more.

*** RBNode

Understanding RBNode (library/rb-node.c) is crucial.  RBNode is not
just used by the Library actually; every other source uses it as well.
RBNode is therefore a pretty abstract thing.  Essentially, it
is a node in a tree, which can have both parents and children.  We
will examine how the tree structure is used shortly.

**** Dynamic properties

An RBNode also has a dynamic set of properties associated with it.  A
property has both a name and a value.  The value can be of many different
types; e.g. a string, integer, or a pointer to another node. 

These dynamic properties pretty much correspond to the song
metadata you can see like song length, duration, location, etc.

**** Thread safety

If you look at the RBNode code, you will notice that it has a lot
of thread locking.  That's because any thread can manipulate the
node database concurrently.  Each RBNode contains a read/write
mutex.  With just one or two sepcial exceptions, all the locking is
handled transparently by the rb_node_* functions.  It is safe to
call e.g. rb_node_set_property from any thread at any time, and
this is in fact done.

*** The tree structure (RBLibrary)

So where does this RBNode parent/children relationship come in?
Rhythmbox maintains a sort of tree structured database of your music.
This is what allows it implement the browser (filtering by genre, artist,
album). As we said, an RBNode is part of a tree.  The Library sets up a
tree (actually technically it's more like a forest) which looks like
this:


       	  Genre1               	     Genre2                  Genre3
         /	---	    	       |       	       	       ...
        /	   \-	    	       |
       Artist1	    Artist2	     Artist3
     --	  |   ---      	 ---	       	--  -----
   -/  	  |	 \-	    Album4     	  \      \---
Album1  Album2   Album3--      	--    	  Album5   Album6---
  |	  /  \	   ---	 \-- 	  \-- 	    \----    ----   \---
  |	-/    \	      \-    \-	     \-	     \	 \---	 \---	\--
Song1  Song2  Song3   Song4 Song5    Song6   Song7  Song8  Song9  Song10

This hierarchy is the core of what Rhythmbox presents to the user.
When you go into the song properties dialog and edit a song title,
you're really changing the RB_NODE_PROP_NAME of an RBNode.  If you
change the artist of an RBNode, it is reparented to the new artist
(and a new album is created if necessary).

**** The "All" nodes maintained by RBLibrary/RBIRadioBackend

Actually, the tree is slightly more complicated than this; besides
The Genre->Artist->Album->Song chains, there are also special
"All" nodes.  These represent the bold "All" entries you see
on the display.  These "All" nodes basically point to
all of one class of node.  For example, there is an "All Songs"
node, which is the parent of every song.
This allows us to easily iterate over all songs, and will come
in handy in a minute when we look at RBNodeView. 

**** Saving/loading

RBNode also has a generic "serialization" infrastructure, which
converts an RBNode to XML, which is then saved to disk.  This is
how Rhythmbox stores information about songs.  If you look in
~/.gnome2/rhythmbox, you should see several XML files there.
Essentially that file just contains property IDs (which correspond
to the values in library/rb-node.h), and their values.

** Node Views (RBNodeView)

Now that we understand that Rhythmbox has this tree database of our
music, a logical question: how is it displayed to the user?  Well,
that's the job of an RBNodeView (lib/widgets/rb-node-view.[ch]).

An RBNodeView basically takes an RBNode and presents it all of its
children using a GtkTreeView.  Remember special the "All" nodes?
This is where they come in; for example, the Library has four
RBNodeViews; one corresponding to  each "All" node.  

Simply speaking, an RBNodeView contains both a GtkTreeView and an
RBTreeModelNode.  The RBTreeModelNode takes care of the details of
implementing the GtkTreeModel interface (see the GTK+ docs for more
details).  Then we just use a GtkTreeView to show that to the user.
RBNodeView hooks in a number of callbacks for sorting and
filtering things, but this is the general idea.

*** Usage

Each RBSource has at least one RBNodeView.  This is also very important
to understand.  RBSource has a method which looks like this:

RBNodeView *	(*impl_get_node_view)	(RBSource *source);

This method is called by RBShellPlayer to access a source's RBNodeView.
The RBNodeView maintains state, such as which song is selected.  When
a song is double-clicked, a signal is emitted which RBShellPlayer catches,
and then gets the currently selected RBNode, and uses it to play the song.

*** Filtering

In addition to providing a view of the RBNode tree, the RBNodeView
also takes care of filtering it, using an RBNodeFilter
(library/rb-node-filter.[ch]).  Note that Rhythmbox is quite fast
at filtering by genre/artist/album.  This is because of the tree
structure used above.  To check whether a particular song should be
displayed, we just check whether it has the selected genre or whatever
as a parent.

** More on the Library

When you add music or delete music in the library, you might notice that it happens
"in the background".  This is because there is are several separate threads
dedicated to processing addition/removal/update requests on the library.

The main one is (unsurprisingly) called RBLibraryMainThread.  This class
continually reads the main RBLibraryActionQueue (which is a queue of pending
requests from the user), and processes them.  For instance, an
RB_LIBRARY_ACTION_ADD_FILE request causes a new node to be created.
Note that the node system itself has the required locks needed for this to work.

There is a secondary thread RBLibraryWalkerThread which is dedicated to handling
recursive library additions.  It has its own RBLibraryActionQueue instance, and
it watches for RB_LIBRARY_ACTION_ADD_DIRECTORY requests.  It then recursively
traverses the URI and adds RB_LIBRARY_ACTION_ADD_FILE requests to the main
queue.

** The Radio Source

Internet radio is handled similarly to the library.  Instead of the
Genre->Artist->Album->Song tree, the hierarchy simply looks like:
Genre->Song.  This hierarchy is maintained by the RBIRadioBackend.
The RBIRadioSource handles most of the user-interface bits such
as popping up dialog boxes and filtering and such.

** The Playlist (Group) Source

Currently the term "group" is used in a number of places in the Rhythmbox
source code.  This term is deprecated in favor of "playlist", and we
are slowly working to convert.

Once we have the library and RBNode, the playlist source is actually pretty
easy to implement.  It maintains a single RBNode similar to the "All" node
of the other sources.  This node is the parent of all the songs in the playlist.

Note also that the Playlist source doesn't have its own backend; instead
it just uses the node database from the library.  In the future, we hope
to unify the backends so that both local songs and internet radio stations
can be added to a playlist.
