How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product rhythmbox.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - MonkeyMedia version
   - GStreamer version
   - Available GStreamer plugins (run gst-inspect with no arguments)
   
  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug.

  If you can reproduce the bug with one of the programs in tests/, that
  will be most convenient.  Otherwise, please include a short test program
  that exhibits the behavior.  As a last resort, you can also provide
  a pointer to a larger piece of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured, and a trace (which can be obtained by using gdb or bug-buddy).

Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch fixes
an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keywoard in their
keyword field.

Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
