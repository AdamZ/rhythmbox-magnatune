	* podcast/rb-podcast-parse.c: (entry_parsed):
	Ignore podcast items with no URI or a URI without a valid scheme.
	Fixes #578398.

2009-04-11  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* lib/Makefile.am:
	* lib/rb-util.c (rb_gvolume_get_udi):
	* lib/rb-util.h: Add rb_gvolume_get_udi utility function to
	get a UDI from a GVolume, even if the gvfs volume monitor doesn't
	use HAL, or export the UDI information (eg. the DeviceKit-disks
	gvfs monitor)
	* plugins/generic-player/rb-generic-player-source.c
	(get_hal_udi_for_player):
	* plugins/generic-player/rb-nokia770-source.c (volume_is_nokia770),
	(rb_nokia770_is_mount_player):
	* plugins/generic-player/rb-psp-source.c (volume_is_psp),
	(rb_psp_is_mount_player):
	* plugins/ipod/rb-ipod-helpers.c (volume_is_ipod),
	(rb_ipod_helpers_is_ipod): Use rb_gvolume_get_udi() to get the UDI
	of the devices

	(Closes: #578514)

2009-04-09  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/artdisplay/artdisplay/__init__.py:
	Limit the cover art image size to one third of the height of the main
	window, so it behaves sensibly when the side pane is expanded to cover
	most of the window.  This avoids forcing the main window to be
	resized.  When above the size limit, center the image in the side pane.
	Fixes #443720.

2009-04-07  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/artdisplay/artdisplay/__init__.py:
	Clear the source ID for the post-resize handler before returning from
	it, so we correctly regenerate the source pixbuf when the cover art
	widget is resized.  Fixes #426164.

2009-04-07  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* configure.ac:
	Require libmusicbrainz3 3.0.2 for per-track artist information.

	* plugins/audiocd/sj-metadata-musicbrainz3.c:
	(make_album_from_release), (mb_list_albums):
	Update from sound-juicer, including fixes for #576574 and #575820.

2009-04-07  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	patch by:  Paul Bellamy  <paul.a.bellamy@gmail.com>

	* rhythmdb/rhythmdb.c: (rhythmdb_entry_is_lossless):
	* rhythmdb/rhythmdb.h:
	Add a function to determine if an entry represents a lossless encoded
	stream.  This currently just checks that the bitrate field is 0 and
	the media type is 'audio/x-flac'.  More media types and other checks
	can be added later.

	* rhythmdb/rhythmdb-query-model.c:
	(rhythmdb_query_model_bitrate_sort_func):
	* rhythmdb/rhythmdb-query-model.h:
	Add a query model sort function for bitrate comparisons, sorting
	lossless encodings as being of higher quality than anything with a
	bitrate.  Not exactly correct, but it's the best we can do.

	* widgets/rb-entry-view.c: (rb_entry_view_quality_cell_data_func),
	(rb_entry_view_append_column):
	* widgets/rb-song-info.c: (rb_song_info_update_bitrate):
	Display "Lossless" for lossless encodings in the 'quality' column in
	track lists and the same field in the song info dialog.

	Fixes #337438.

2009-04-06  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/audiocd/sj-metadata.c: (sj_metadata_helper_scan_date),
	(sj_metadata_helper_check_media):
	Update from sound-juicer, including fix for #578060.

2009-04-06  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/magnatune/magnatune/MagnatuneSource.py:
	Catch parser exceptions and sort of pretend we can keep going, though
	all that will show up in the track list will be what we parsed before
	the error.  Fixes #574465.

	Replace a couple of strange characters that appear in the XML with
	best guesses as to what they're supposed to be.  This lets us parse
	the current catalog file successfully.

2009-04-06  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* backends/gstreamer/rb-player-gst-xfade.c: (add_bus_watch),
	(start_sink_locked), (start_sink), (create_sink):
	Remove the bus watch before trying to start the sink.  If we're not
	doing this from the main thread, the main thread could process the
	messages before the loop in start_sink_locked could, so it'd just sit
	there waiting.  Fixes #577840.

2009-04-03  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* widgets/rb-query-creator-properties.c:
	(create_time_unit_option_menu):
	* widgets/rb-query-creator.c: (rb_query_creator_constructor),
	(setup_sort_option_menu):
	Ensure all combo boxes always have an item selected.

2009-04-02  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/artdisplay/artdisplay/LocalCoverArtSearchGIO.py:
	Finish implementing saving of cover art.

2009-03-31  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/mtpdevice/rb-mtp-source.c: (artwork_notify_cb):
	Use correct printf format for the image size.

2009-03-30  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/mtpdevice/rb-mtp-source.c: (rb_mtp_source_init),
	(rb_mtp_source_constructor), (rb_mtp_source_finalize),
	(load_mtp_db_idle_cb), (add_track_to_album),
	(remove_track_from_album), (impl_delete), (transfer_track),
	(impl_track_added), (artwork_notify_cb):
	Create album objects on the device when transferring songs, and delete
	them when the last song is removed.  If all of the existing albums
	have zero tracks, try to rebuild the albums when reading the song
	list.  This helps with some odd devices that forget all album contents
	when they restart.

	If the device supports the JPEG file type, request album art when
	transferring songs, and send it to the device as a 'representative
	sample' of the album.

	* lib/eggsmclient.c: (egg_sm_client_init),
	* lib/eggsmclient.h:
	* lib/Makefile.am:
	Add session management code copied from libegg.

	* lib/rb-file-helpers.c: (rb_dot_dir):
	Replace GNOME_DOT_GNOME with ".gnome2" - pretty safe to assume that
	this isn't going to change.

	* plugins/daap/rb-daap-source.c: (mount_op_reply_cb),
	(ask_password), (connection_auth_cb):
	When building with gtk+ 2.14 or newer, use GtkMountOperation to ask
	for passwords instead of GnomePasswordDialog.

	* shell/rb-shell-preferences.c: (help_cb):
	Fix the help URI for the preferences section, round up gtk version
	check numbers.

	* shell/rb-shell.c: (rb_shell_create_mount_op_cb),
	(rb_shell_cmd_contents), (session_save_state_cb),
	(session_quit_cb), (rb_shell_session_init):
	Use EggSMClient instead of GnomeClient for session management, round
	up the gtk version check numbers.

	* shell/main.c: (main):
	Parse options directly (including option groups for EggSMClient and
	gtk), load and save the accelerator map file ourselves (replacing
	gnome_accelerators_sync), stop calling glade_gnome_init (it doesn't do
	anything anyway), and set the application name and window icon via
	egg_set_desktop_file.
	
	* configure.ac:
	Only require libgnome when building with gtk+ < 2.14.  Fixes #576038.

2009-03-29  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/cd-recorder/rb-playlist-source-recorder.c:
	(rb_playlist_source_recorder_constructor):
	Use the right user data for the device-changed signal.  Fixes #365154.

2009-03-29  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* widgets/rb-song-info.c: (rb_song_info_constructor):
	Set mnemonic-widget property of the 'rating' label to point to the
	rating widget.  Fixes #576673.

2009-03-29  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* data/glade/podcast-prefs.glade:
	Set mnemonic_widget property of the 'download location' widget so the
	shortcut selects the file chooser.  Fixes #576925.

	patch by:  Niels Vorgaard Christensen  <vorgaard.c@math.ku.dk>

	* plugins/artdisplay/artdisplay/__init__.py:
	Answer cover art requests for any entry, not just the current playing
	one.  Fixes #529873.

2009-03-26  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* sources/rb-auto-playlist-source.c: (impl_search):
	If we don't have the base query yet, defer the search until we do.

	* plugins/generic-player/rb-nokia770-source.c:
	(rb_nokia770_source_new):
	* plugins/generic-player/rb-psp-source.c: (rb_psp_source_new):
	Set the ignore and error entry types for these to 'invalid' rather
	than leaving them NULL.  Fixes #510236.

2009-03-24  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* backends/gstreamer/rb-encoder-gst.c (add_decoding_pipeline):
	* backends/gstreamer/rb-player-gst-xfade.c (create_stream):
	Use decodebin2 instead of decodebin, fixed playback of chained ogg
	streams

2009-03-23  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* rhythmdb/rhythmdb.c: (process_added_entries_cb),
	(rhythmdb_add_uri_with_types):
	Fix a double-unlock of the stat mutex, add comments explaining the
	slight weirdness in the way it's unlocked.  Probably fixes #576238.

2009-03-22  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/artdisplay/artdisplay/CoverArtDatabase.py:
	Make the ticket system code a bit less inscrutable, remove items from
	the hash when the last ticket is forgotten, and add a method to search
	for existing items with live tickets that match a new item.

	When a new cover art search request arrives, look for already running
	searches for the same artist and album.  If an existing search is
	found, just wait for the results rather than doing the same search
	again.  From #529873.

2009-03-21  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* plugins/jamendo/jamendo/JamendoSource.py:
	* plugins/rb/Loader.py:
	Work around bug 575781 in the loader code rather than the code that
	calls it.

2009-03-20  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* configure.ac:
	* widgets/rb-search-entry.c: (rb_search_entry_init),
	(rb_search_entry_clear_cb):
	If available, use gtk 2.16's new GtkEntry API for the 'clear' icon
	in the search entry, rather than libsexy's SexyIconEntry.
	Incidentally fixes #513828.

2009-03-20  Jonathan Matthew  <jonathan@d14n.org>

	* backends/gstreamer/rb-player-gst-xfade.c: (unlink_blocked_cb):

	patch by:  Kim Sullivan  <alicebot@seznam.cz>

	* plugins/jamendo/jamendo/JamendoSaxHandler.py:
	* plugins/jamendo/jamendo/JamendoSource.py:
	Rework the jamendo xml parser to create database entries in a single
	pass, rather than creating an intermediate structure and converting
	that to database entries.  Speeds up catalogue loading and reduces
	memory consumption.  From #424423.

2009-03-19  Christophe Fergeau <cfergeau@mandriva.com>

	* configure.ac: remove unused AC_CHECK_HEADER, spotted by vuntz.
