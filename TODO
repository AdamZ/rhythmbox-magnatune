I'm currently working on:
=========================

Features:
---------
* Implement small view

* Contextmenu on nodeview

Open tasks:
===========

  If one of the many id3 ones have been used, we can use custom.
* Disc number support?
* In info dialog mtime, play count, last played, file kind, sample rate
* Better random mode

* Searching
* CD ripping
* Ellipsize artist/album link widgets
* Smart playlists

* Visualization
* "Open stream" feature
* All actions should be reversable (undo/redo support) everywhere, so we dont
need confirmation dialogs

* Save filtering state
