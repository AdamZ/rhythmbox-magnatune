I'm currently working on:
=========================

Bugs:
-----
* Solve gnome_vfs_monitor_add problem
* Check where slowness comes from -- the xml loading and
  tree building only takes like 1 sec.
* Sometimes crash on exit? (gnome_vfs_shutdown prob)
* We don't unref the mixer atm (see above)

* Do mtime checking when adding watched dir and file is already in lib
* Changing files while rb is running is still horked, esp when changing
  artist/album/genre.
* If an artist has album kid without grandchildren needs to begone
* Check for file extisnce when loading from xml (thread..)

Features:
---------
* Implement small view
* Smart column sizing
* Show current song should change filtering options to show song
* Volume label instead of icon??
* Contextmenu on nodeview

* rewrite library once again :-( This time think to refcounting and threads..

Open tasks:
===========

* Implement a const char **monkey_media_list_all_genres (void) in monkeymedia,
and use that in rb-song-info.c.
* Fix entry in sidebar becoming 4 pixels larger than requested
* Implement internet radio
* Implement audio cd
* Move volume code to be a volume object in monkeymedia
* Implement tag editing
* Smart tag fixing
* Album cover support
