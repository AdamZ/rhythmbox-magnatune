TODO

I'm currently working on:
=========================

Bugs:
-----
* Solve gnome_vfs_monitor_add problem
* Check where slowness comes from -- the xml loading and
  tree building only takes like 1 sec.
* Sometimes crash on exit? (gnome_vfs_shutdown prob)
* We don't unref the mixer atm (see above)

* Do mtime checking when adding watched dir and file is already in lib
* Changing files while rb is running is still horked, esp when changing
  artist/album/genre.
* If an artist has album kid without grandchildren needs to begone
* Check for file extisnce when loading from xml (thread..)

Features:
---------
* Implement small view
* Smart column sizing
* Show current song should change filtering options to show song
* Volume label instead of icon??
* Contextmenu on nodeview

* rewrite library once again :-( This time think to refcounting and threads..

Open tasks:
===========

* Support for custom volume on songs
* Column editor/more columns (rating, last played, play count)
* More select number of genres, with None and Custom like in iTunes.
  If one of the many id3 ones have been used, we can use custom.
* Disc number support?
* In info dialog mtime, play count, last played, file kind, sample rate
* Better random mode
* Fix entry in sidebar becoming 4 pixels larger than requested
* Implement internet radio
* Implement audio cd
* Move volume code to be a volume object in monkeymedia
* Implement tag editing
* Smart tag fixing
* Album cover support
* Searching
* CD ripping
* Ellipsize artist/album link widgets
* Smart playlists
* Feature to rename files to sane filenames
* Visualization
* "Open stream" feature
* All actions should be reversable (undo/redo support) everywhere, so we dont
need confirmation dialogs
* File mass tagging
* Sort by tracknumber by default, and make it work something like Artist->Album->Tracknum
* Clicking on volume icon to mute/unmute
* iTunes-like checkbuttons so you can mark songs to be skipped?
* "Rename group" dialog instead of editable label hack?
