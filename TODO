Tasks:
======

- Easy:
  ====
  
* Disc number support
* Better random mode
* Album cover support
* Better alert dialogs
* Sane defaults (pane pos, window size, show browser by default)
* Access keys in song info should highlight contents
* Better genre in songinfo: separate styles and genres? (Use sentence case in genre dropdown in any case)
* Group views need to be reorderable
* Stop button in systray menu doesnt make sense: just keep it pause/playnig
* tray: tooltip when changing song?
* tray: play/pause instead of current icon? and dump hiding feature.. instead have an iconify/restore menuitem
* update-from-egg.sh
* .keys file
* Use RBFileMonitor in song-info
* Contextmenu on nodeview (?)
* Better status message (we dont need megs i guess)
* Commit new playlist icon
* Last played date is given in seconds, which is prolly unnecessary
* Comments in songinfo in separate tab?
* Remove "Add to library", nautilus is the way to add files.
* Changing tb editing while playing gives interesting results
* Prettier playing area, like phonic
* Add a context menu in nautilus: "Add to Rhythmbox"

* Better icons for library, groups, appicon, and trayicon.
* Ellipsizing celltextrenderer
* Multiple selection in artist/album browser
* DNDing whole multiple-artist albums is broken, should prolly bundle
  a filter object or something iwth the dnd.

  move sel up and down (a la xmms)

* "Narrowing view", ie only selecting currently playing artist/album
* DnD to applet
* File mass tagging
* Move kb focus to row when jumping to playing song
* auto-jump to when pressing prev/next should be fixed
* Occasionally random returns invisible nodes, esp with previous
* Not playing when everything is shown?
* Sometimes hangs on start?
* Play count should prolly be updated when halfway the song, not on eos.
* Compress XML file?
* Store locale in xml, so that we can invalidate the collated keys and
  tracknumbers when it changes.
* View stuff is still confusing
* Delete shoud check which treeview is selected; and cut/copy/paste album/artist
* Support dragging groups to trashcan
* autoremove browser in very small window
* small view?
* Contextmenus not working
* FIx up rblink
* Smart column selection (artist, album shown when "All" or multiple artist/albums selected, or when browser hidden, otherwisde hidden, etc)

- Hard:
  ====
* Use medusa to find all ogg/mp3 on the user's system
* Re-enable monitoring when FAM is fixed
* Incremental statusbar updating while loading

- Trascendence:
  ============

* All actions should be reversable (undo/redo support) everywhere, so we dont
need confirmation dialogs
