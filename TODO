Tasks:
======

- Easy:
  ====
  
* Disc number support
* Better random mode
  This one is a little tricky.  How hard do we want to try to
  avoid songs being played multiple times in one "random" session?  Doing
  this implies keeping track of all the songs we've played so far; but
  we have to cleanly handle library additions AND deletions for nodes
  in this list.
* Album cover support
* Better alert dialogs
* Sane defaults (pane pos, window size, show browser by default)
* Access keys in song info should highlight contents
* Better genre in songinfo: separate styles and genres? (Use sentence case in genre dropdown in any case)
* Group views need to be reorderable
* Stop button in systray menu doesnt make sense: just keep it pause/playnig
* tray: tooltip when changing song?
* tray: play/pause instead of current icon? and dump hiding feature.. instead have an iconify/restore menuitem
* Use RBFileMonitor in song-info
* Better status message (we dont need megs i guess)
* Comments in songinfo in separate tab?
* Remove "Add to library", nautilus is the way to add files.
* Changing tb editing while playing gives interesting results
* Prettier playing area, like phonic
* Use scrollbar if columns really dont fit in nodeview [jorn]
* Separate columns config for groups?
* Corrs, The vs Corrs, the
* Fix context menu tips
* Change rating widget to not expand, have same space left of stars as right
* DnD from genreview
* Be sure All-whatever is selected when browser pref changes
* monkey-media should be a bit more clever when songs don't have a title
* monkey-media should use get the mime-type by data instead of extension
* Make all the icons themeable if applicable
* Resizable columns
* large icons in the Source table (configurable)

- Medium:
  ======
  
* Implement audio cd [Kenneth]
* Implement tag editing
* Tag fixing with musicbrainz
* CD ripping
* Ellipsize artist/album link widgets
* Smart playlists
* Visualization (FX Plugins) [Sienap]

* Autoscroll to playing node after perioud of interface inactivity (?)
* First time startup stuff (Wizard)

* Properly drawn DND hints on sidebar
* Support opening groups in new windows for easy editing (?)
* Multiple tag support in songinfo and rb itself
* Multiple songs of same node in a group
* Save treeview state and filtering state
* Save/restore toolbar position
* "View browser" should work with gconf notifier
* Support for custom volume on songs + edition in the song info [Olive]
* Ellipsizing celltextrenderer
* Multiple selection in artist/album browser
* DNDing whole multiple-artist albums is broken, should prolly bundle
  a filter object or something iwth the dnd.
* Search: Enter should start playing selected search result, arrows should
  move sel up and down (a la xmms)
* Ditch filepicker when we have a decent filemanager in gnome
* Previous/Next is slow on a big treeview
* Figure out right behaviour for current song pointer in songinfo vs. selected row
* Songinfo should connect to some changed signal on the RBNode
* Don't sort on tracknum by default for groups
* Mute menuitem
* check Quality: high or Quality: High capitalization with the HIG
* Figure proper tracknunber format (01 vs. 01 of 11)
* Statusbar text should maybe left aligned (?)
* Help buttons in toolbar editor and properties dialog
* Rating should prelight to indicate it's editable
* Fade out on exit (?)
* Song queue thing (?)
* Columns resizable and reorderable once we can save the state
* Fix delete slowness
* Statusmessage when changing filtering should be something like "Filtering..."
* Jump to current song tb button
* Show browser tb button
* Play in sidebar c ontextmenu? doubleclick to play? (?)
* Pointer-cursor with small clock when adding to lib (HIG)
* Periodically save lib and groups
* Replace sidebar with list, so we can have more groups, and make the
  playing source bold (?)
* Different playing icon for playing than for paused (?)
* Reintroduce watched folders? (?) (gnome-wide monitoring service?)
* "Narrowing view", ie only selecting currently playing artist/album
* DnD to applet
* File mass tagging
* Move kb focus to row when jumping to playing song
* auto-jump to when pressing prev/next should be fixed
* Occasionally random returns invisible nodes, esp with previous
* Not playing when everything is shown?
* Sometimes hangs on start?
* Play count should prolly be updated when halfway the song, not on eos.
* Compress XML file?
* Store locale in xml, so that we can invalidate the collated keys and
  tracknumbers when it changes.
* View stuff is still confusing
* Delete shoud check which treeview is selected; and cut/copy/paste album/artist
* Support dragging groups to trashcan
* autoremove browser in very small window
* small view?
* Contextmenus not working
* FIx up rblink
* Smart column selection (artist, album shown when "All" or multiple artist/albums selected, or when browser hidden, otherwisde hidden, etc)

- Hard:
  ====
* Use medusa to find all ogg/mp3 on the user's system
* Re-enable monitoring when FAM is fixed
* Incremental statusbar updating while loading

- Transcendence:
  ============

* All actions should be reversable (undo/redo support) everywhere, so we don't
need confirmation dialogs
