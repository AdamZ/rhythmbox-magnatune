In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

- use 8-space tabs for indentation
- curly brackets are NOT on a new line, except for function definitions.
  (we are slowly converting the code)
- if statements are written like this: "if (this != that)"
- g_list_next/previous is preferred to list->next or list->previous
- every function should have a prototype
- callback functions have a suffix _cb

  Important comment blocks are written like this:
  
/**
 * bla_bla_cb: This is an example comment block
 */

  Here is a correctly indented code sample:

void
foo (const char *bla, gpointer cow)
{
	if (!strcmp (bla, cow)) {
		g_print ("moo!");
		return;
	} else {
		do_something (cow);	
		do_something_else (bla, cow);

	if (foo)
	    return;

	...
}	

You may commit small, obvious fixes to this module.  Anything larger
should be run by Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>, unless you
know I've given you blanket commit permission.
