In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

- use 8-space tabs for indentation
- curly brackets are on a new line
- please compare with NULL or FALSE isntead of using "!"
- if statements are written like this: "if (this != that)"
- g_list_next/previous is preferred to list->next or list->previous
- every function should have a prototype
- callback functions have a suffix _cb

  Comment blocks are written like this:
  
/**
 * bla_bla_cb: This is an example comment block
 */
